# Android-debloat-scripts

Are you tired of buying a brand new Android smartphone, only to find it filed to the brim with pre-installed bloatware?
Me too.


These scripts are made to debloat your smartphone using the Android Debug Bridge(ADB for short) to remove unwanted packages or privacy invasive bloatware. For now only 2 scripts templates are available, the Android 8 and the Android 10 one. Still, many packages have the same name even in different devices or Android version.

## DISCLAIMER: I am not resposible for anything happening to your device, these scripts are given "as is" without any warranty. Still you can contact me if you have something to ask.
=====================

## Preparation
For the script to work USB debugging needs to be enabled on the device.
Here's how to enable it:

1. Go to the settings app and scroll down to "About Phone".
2. Enter the "Software information" page.
3. Tap on the option "Build number until it asks you to confirm enabling Developer Options".
4. Go into the "Developer Options", find and enable USB Debugging.

## Installation
Choose your specific distro script (for example, choose the ARCH one if you are on a Arch based system).
========

## Usage
To use the desired script, run:

chmod a+x NAME-OF-THE-SCRIPT.sh

./NAME-OF-THE-SCRIPT.sh

## Why are the scripts called like Samsung phones?
These scripts are tested on the smartphones "Samsung Galaxy A3(2017)" and "Samsung Galaxy A01 Core" but they should work on every Android 8(Oreo) and Android 10 device.

The Galaxy A3 script is fro android 8.
The Galaxy A01 Core script is for Android 10.
